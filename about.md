Thanks for looking at my blog. I made it to help myself keep track of the things I learn
but if anything on here can help anyone else that would be awesome.

My background is primarily C# and MS-SQL so I enjoy all things Microsoft but I am enjoying 
learning about Node and JS development. I also aim to improve my front end development
skills.

My main areas of experience include

* C#
* MS-SQL
* Umbraco
* Azure
* IIS
* Node
