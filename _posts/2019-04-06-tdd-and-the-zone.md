I've been thinking recently about why I think TDD is so effective. I think I write better code when I develop using TDD, but I'm also happier when I do. Writing cleaner code probably has something to do with that, but I think it also has something to do with the fabled “zone”.

## Tests != TDD

Writing tests does not mean TDD. TDD is when your design is guided by the tests. By following the red, green, refactor steps the design will emerge through writing the minimal amount of code to make your tests pass.

If you write all of your code first then go back to add tests, you are not using TDD.

## Benefits of TDD

In my opinion, TDD is a massively helpful tool when trying to write clean and maintainable code. I'll probably look at the benefits of TDD and the approaches to realise those benefits in other posts.

However, recently I've been starting to notice that by following TDD I've been noticing other benefits that aren't immediately apparent from looking at my code. I've been noticing that I spend more time in the elusive “zone”.

## What is the zone

People often refer to the “zone” as the productive state of mind where you write your best code, everything comes easily to you, and amazing applications shoot out of your finger tips. I might have exaggerated that last bit.

While I do think done people put too much faith in the zone, I do believe it can take time to get in to a productive state of mind.


## How TDD can help with the zone

I've always seen a bit of a running theme with a lot of developers that interruptions are terrible. 

I agree that it can take me time to get back up to speed after an interruption. But I don't think my productivity is more important than anyone elses. If somebody needs to interrupt me, I want them to feel free to do so.

This is where I find following a TDD approach can help with productivity. One of the best pieces of development advice I was ever given was “go home on a failing test”. That way, when you come back in the next day is much easier to pick up where you left off.

Using the XP principle of turn up the good, I try and always leave my work on a failing test whenever I have to leave my work. Having that failing test is much easier to focus on rather than trying to remember exactly what I was doing before.

If anyone else has any good tips on trying to stay productive I'd love to hear them.
