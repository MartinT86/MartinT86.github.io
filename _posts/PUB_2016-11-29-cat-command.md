Here is another Linux command that I want to remember; the cat command.

## My Linux command posts

These posts are NOT supposed to be exhaustive documentation for the commands they cover, but are here as a reminder for myself as I've found them useful and my memory is terrible.

## The cat command

The cat (concatenate) command is pretty useful. It can be used make files, look at the contents of a file and combine files to make a new one.

## Why I needed it



## How I used it

    cat file1.txt file2.txt > myNewFile.txt
    
Much easier than going in to each file, copying the contents, pasting in to a new file and remembering which files I had already done.
