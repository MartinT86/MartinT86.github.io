Delivering value in small, consistent amounts is an important feature of working in a lean manner and enabling a good feedback loop to ensure you are delivering the most value possible. However, I was taught a lesson recently in thinking about my approach and not thinking one approach will fit every situation.

## Continuous delivery

Continuou delivery is where you will always keep your software in deployable state, have the ability to complete automated deployments easily, and release small value changes often opposed to large infrequent deployments. I'm a huge believer in the benefits of continuous delivery and it's something I always try and work towards whatever project I am working on.

Continuous delivery is a topic in itself so I'm not going to go in to too much detail here; Martin Fowler goes in to further detail [here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html).

## What is value?

Value can mean different things to different people. 

Gaining value from releases can be in the form of increaesed conversion, learning more about your market, or performance improvements to name just a few.

These are all valuable outcomes of releasing software, however it is important to keep in mind the actual goal of the software. If you haven't read [The Goal](http://martint86.github.io/the-goal/) you should definitely add it to your reading list. It warns of focusing on efficiencies in the wrong parts of your system. For example spending time making one part of your process super efficient when you have a bottle neck further down the production line is effort wasted. Similarly having a focus on the reduction in waste may seem like value added; however if that reduction in waste has a negative impact on your overall output it may actually be reducing value overall.

## My lesson learned



!!!!!!!Look at change logs for some big apps



!!!!!!!Nice to look at things from a different perspective
