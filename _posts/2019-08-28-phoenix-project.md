I've finally gotten around to reading the Phoenix Project! With practical advice on how to improve the performance of an IT department, it's a great read for anyone who is involved with software projects. 

It's a spiritual successor to the AMAZING book, the Goal. It takes Goldratt's principles and applies them directly to the software development world. It does a great job at doing this, but I would definitely recommend you read the Goal first to fully appreciate the lessons provided.

## Who this book is for

Unlike the goal, the phoenix project is focused on IT delivery. The story follows an IT manager and how he turned around a failing IT department within a failing company.

Obviously this book is a great fit for anyone involved in the delivery of software but the lessons in it could be applied to many different situations.

## Erik 

The first thing I've got to talk about in the book is the enigmatic guru Erik. 

Throughout the book, Erik gives little pieces of advice to the protagonist to help him improve the situation of the company. To be fair, I agree wholeheartedly with the lessons, but I think the way he delivers them is shocking. An example of his unacceptable behaviour is he refuses to use people's correct names until they agree with his points.

Just because you may know more than someone on a particular topic doesn't mean that you should talk down to them. If anything, it is the opposite, you should work with someone to understand what experience gave you that knowledge and share it.

Now my rant is over I'll look at some of the great ideas in the book.

## What I enjoyed in the book

If you only take one lesson away from the phoenix project it should be to identify and widen your bottlenecks. A bottleneck is an area in your business that has the smallest limited capacity and therefore is restricting the flow of the system.

In the book, the bottleneck is an engineer called Brent. Brent is the only one who knows how a lot of systems work. So a lot of work gets piled up behind him in the system. By identifying this as a bottleneck, you can start to look for ways to widen it. Ideally this would be to train other engineers on the activities Brent does. But even having someone helping him would be good. The person helping him might not feel as efficient as they are not doing "their job" but the system as a whole will improve.

Focusing on where the value is also massively important. Rather than continuously starting more work that never makes it to live, focus on the work that is closest to live. Visualizing the work in progress can be massively helpful with this. There are loads of tools such as Trello that can help. Or even using cards like they do in the book.

Many small deployments is another realization that they came to in the book. I couldn't agree with this more. If deployments are a scary struggle, don't wait and bundle them all together for a big bang release. Do them more often!

To help with his you should be looking at automating your deployments. If there is a human element within a deployment method, at some point it will definitely go wrong.

## Great book, now go read the goal

The phoenix project is a decent book with a lot of good points being made.

Anything that advocates for better delivery of software is worthy of reading. However it's not been able to replace my love for the goal. I found the lessons in the goal to be more impactful for myself. This was down to the goal not being software oriented and I had to see how they applied to software delivery myself.
