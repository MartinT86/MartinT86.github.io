Either a great introduction to agile development or a reminder of how to focus on what value is and how to get it.

## Who the book is for

I really enjoyed the style of this book. There aren't a lot of words on a page and each page has pictures.
That might not make me sound the sharpest tool in the box, and maybe I'm not, but for someone who reads a couple of minutes 
here and there on a commute it helps a lot.

I've been working in agile environments for a few years now and I still found this book useful. It's simple layout and message of
"keep it simple" is a really nice reminder that if things are complicated, you are probably doing them wrong.

In the intro, Uncle Bob describes this book as a must for CTOs, directors of software and team leaders. While I think that is true, 
I think it would be better for a wider audience to read this book. It would be amazing if this book was read by the recipients of
software. Agile development has a lot of benefits, but those benefits are hard to achieve if all parties aren't bought in to the 
process.
