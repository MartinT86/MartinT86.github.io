Either a great introduction to agile development or a reminder of how to focus on what value is and how to get it.

## Who the book is for

I really enjoyed the style of this book. There aren't a lot of words on a page and each page has pictures.
That might not make me sound the sharpest tool in the box, and maybe I'm not, but for someone who reads a couple of minutes 
here and there on a commute it helps a lot.

I've been working in agile environments for a few years now and I still found this book useful. It's simple layout and message of
"keep it simple" is a really nice reminder that if things are complicated, you are probably doing them wrong.

In the intro, Uncle Bob describes this book as a must for CTOs, directors of software and team leaders. While I think that is true, 
I think it would be better for a wider audience to read this book. It would be amazing if this book was read by the recipients of
software. Agile development has a lot of benefits, but those benefits are hard to achieve if all parties aren't bought in to the 
process.

## What is a feature?

A lot of the book is centered around the importance of features.

We should plan by features, we should build by features, we should even grow our teams around features.
Working towards features does have a lot of advantages. Planning is easier with smaller chunks, it is easier to pivot the project and while I think estimates are rarely helpful, it is easier to estimate smaller pieces of work.

However, I wonder if feature is the best term for what we should be breaking the work down in to?
Would something more in keeping with the agile ideas of always being in a releasable state and getting value from releases like "deliverable" be more appropriate. Sometimes I find that the term "feature" is too easily interchangeable with "project".

Once the term feature gets swapped with project, it makes realising agile benefits such as being able to work on the most valuable thing
at the time difficult. As people often like the feeling of completeness that comes with finishing a project.
