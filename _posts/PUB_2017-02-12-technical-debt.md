You hear the term "technical debt" a lot in development. You also hear a lot of discussion about how to deal with it.
Here I'm going to discuss why I don't like the term.

## What is technical debt

From my experience, "technical debt" is a term applied to any technical task that isn't directly related to a new feature.

Examples of this could be, refactoring an old piece of code, scripting the creation of a site, putting a new type of 
automated tests in place.

## Why I don't like the term

I'm saying technical tasks aren't important. I hope they are or I'd be out of work.

The term "technical debt" hides the real reason that the technical task should be carried out. I see it as if someone asks why
you are doing that task your response could be "you don't need to worry about it, it's technical".

It implies that there isn't value to be gained from doing that work, like paying a debt, you aren't improving your balance just getting
back to zero.

## Focus on value



## Then what should we call it?

Work is work and you should be working on the most valuable thing you can. It shouldn't matter if that work is adding a new feature 

## How we should deal with technical issues
