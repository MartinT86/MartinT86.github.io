It's the little things in life that make me happy and the new file icons available for Visual Studio Code make me very happy.

## The new icons

For the [August Visual Studio Code release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_5) there is now
the option to show file and folder icons.

This may sound like just a small visual tweak but I've found it to be really useful in 
finding files I need faster.

## How to enable

Enabling the icons is easy and the update comes with two icon sets.

To enable just go to File > Preferences > File Icon Theme and select one.

## More icons!

If you feel the need for more icons, there are already more icon sets available in the
[marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=icons&target=VSCode&sortBy=Relevance)
