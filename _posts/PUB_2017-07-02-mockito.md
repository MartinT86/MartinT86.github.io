Yet another post about testing.

Recently I've been working mainly on Android projects using Java so I decided I needed to learn how to write tests in Java.
Here is example of how to use Mockito.

## Dependency


testCompile 'org.mockito:mockito-core:1.10.19'
## RunWith

Using the RunWith annotation, you attach the Mockito test runner to your test class;

@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)

## Test


## mock


## Captor


## when


## verify
