It's been a while since I've written a blog post.

I'm not normally one for putting a lot of stock in to the new year. However, this year I'm excited for the year to come and learn new things.

GraphQL, AWS and agile processes are all things I'm aiming to further my knowledge in.

Good luck to everyone for 2019!
