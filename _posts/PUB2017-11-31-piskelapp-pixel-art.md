In my attempts to learn game development I thought I better give pixel art a go.

I used the AMAZING web app Piskel for my first efforts. As a non-artist and knowing nothing about pixel art before starting, I found Piskel to be the perfect place to start. Check it out [here](https://www.piskelapp.com/)

## Piskel

Piskel is an online pixel art creation tool. It has an amazing selection of tools and options to get you up and running creating your first pixel art attempts quickly and intuitively. While I am defintely NOT an expert, I found I could get something together pretty quickly.

You get the usual sort of tools that you would expect from a simple drawing package; line tools, shape tools, selections etc. Piskel really came in to its own for me though in its layers and frames.

In each frame you can set layers as you would in other drawing programs. I found this to be massively useful when atempting to animate my pixel art. Once you are happy with a frame, when creating a new one you have a few options to speed up the process. You can clone a previous frame, flip it, crop it etc. These might not seem impressive to someone who knows what they are taling about but I found them massively helpful.
