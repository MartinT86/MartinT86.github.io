I'm always trying to think of new ideas to do in a retro and when I read about Covey's Cirlces it seemed like a great idea for the team to try and come up with an action for improvement.

One of Covey's 7 habits of effective people is to be proactive. One way he describes you can be proactive is to look at your Circle of Influence nad your Circle of Concern.

Your Circle of Influence are things that you have some degree of control over where our Circle of Concern contains things that might impact you but you don't have control over.

To be proactive you work from your centre of influence
