I don't think it's possible to overstate the importance of unit tests. Ideally they'd be created through following test driven development but that's a different issue. 

By sharing your unit tests with your team, by using HTML reporters you can get even more value out of them as living documentation.

## What unit tests do

A strong set of unit tests gives several huge benefits to a system.

Tests that allow for small feedback loops while testing the whole system reduces the need for full manual regression tests for each code change. In turn, this increases the confidence that code changes won't break the system.

Similarly, refactoring would be very difficult without unit tests. 

allow refactoring

also, show intent

## living documentation

tacit knowledge grows over time
unit tests shouoldn't be reflection of the code
