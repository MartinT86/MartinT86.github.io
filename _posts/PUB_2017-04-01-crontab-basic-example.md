After having recently moved to a Mac from a Windows laptop, the loss of many features that I took for granted has been daunting.
Losing the Task Scheduler is one such example. However, we have Crontab to the rescue.

## Crontab

A cron job is just a command to run and the schedule that it should be run on.

Crontab is just a collection of those cron jobs. So it does appear we are losing a lot of functionality if you compare it to Task Scheduler, such as having triggers that are not based around time only. 

## -e


## -l


## cron schedule
