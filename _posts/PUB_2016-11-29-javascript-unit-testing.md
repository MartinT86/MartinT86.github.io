I've decided to start writing it properly and learn how unit testing can work in Javascript.

## Mocha

I decided to go with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as my test framework as it seems pretty popular and I've heard good things about it.

Good old npm made it wasy to setup as usual.

    npm install mocha --save-dev
    
Initially I decided not to bring in any assertion libraries such as Chai as it was a small project relying on node's
assert library seemed adequate.

## request module

### done()

If you have any asynchronous code that has a callback you'll need to use the done method.

## npm scripts

## nodemon

## Refactoring

## Slower

## Now I'm calmer
