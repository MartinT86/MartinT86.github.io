Recently I had the opportunity to take part in a debate of trunk based development vs branching. Here's how it went.

## What is trunk based development?

In trunk based development all developers work only from the trunk or master. No branches are created for feature development or releases. You work on master and release from master.

Other factors may influence exactly how this is implemented though. For example, depending on the team size and composition, you may create short lived branches for peer reviews or pull requests. However, it is important that the spirit of trunk based development is still observed and these branches are short lived.

For more information on trunk based development, [here](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) is a great website explaining it in much more detail.
