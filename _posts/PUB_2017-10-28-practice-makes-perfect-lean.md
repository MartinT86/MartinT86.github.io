Here's how and why I built my last app following ean principles - Practice makes Perfect

## The app

My new app "Practice makes Perfect" is designed to be a tool to be used when learning a new skill. There is a theory that puts forward, if you practise something for 10,000 hours you become an expert in that skill. Practice makes Perfect, aloows you to keep track of your practise sessions by recording each one and totalling up your overall time practising time.

I came up with the idea for the app while learning my own hobbies. While playing the banjo I was wondering how long I had been learning it for overall.

## Is there interest?

## Budget

## Holding back

## Feedback

## Next steps
