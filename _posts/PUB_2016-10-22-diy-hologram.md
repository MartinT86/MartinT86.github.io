Here's my DIY hologram from Microsoft since I can't afford a Hololens.

## It's a hologram coming out of your phone!

I felt like I was in Star Trek.

<div class="center">
<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/hologram.jog"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/hologram.jpg" alt="my diy hologram"></a>
	<figcaption>My DIY hologram</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

OK, bit of an exaggeration but I still thought it was pretty cool.

The instructions from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/developers/articles/week02jan16/how-to-create-3D-holograms-on-your-phone-and-why/) 
can be found here. I think this is a great example from Microsoft of how, with a little bit of creativity, 
you can turn a digital experience in to a physical one. 

## Time to get the scissors out

On the instructions is a template for the prism to print and cut out of clear plastic.
From my experience I would make the template a little bigger than the instructions state. 
I found this made the prism a little easier to stand up.

## How it works

Once you have the prism, you place it on your phone as the gif plays. The gif gets reflected in to 
prism and you have your floating hologram!

If you are a better designer than I am you can make your own gif to use.
However you can always use the example gifs that are supplied with the instructions.

I was amazed by my hologram but it did leave me wanting a Hololens. Time to get saving I guess.
